Thumbs Up Detection Using MediaPipe
Welcome to the Thumbs Up Detection project repository! This project uses MediaPipe, an open-source framework, to detect the "thumbs up" gesture in real-time. The application leverages MediaPipe's robust hand-tracking capabilities to identify and respond to the thumbs up gesture, showcasing potential applications in human-computer interaction, accessibility, and beyond.
